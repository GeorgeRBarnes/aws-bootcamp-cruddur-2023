# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
During Week 0 of Andrew Brown's Cloud Bootcamp the I and the rest of my cohort were introduced to the project as well as it's requirements and planning that needed to be done. There were practical tasks that had to be done such as setting up the aws-cli as well as configuring billing alarms on my AWS account. 

# Case study and Gathering Requirements
We started by learning about the importance of gathering requirements before starting any project. This involves understanding the user's needs, business objectives, and the constraints of the project. It helps to ask questions, there was emphasis on asking dumb questions to determine the risks, assumptions and constraints of the client. This helps in creating a solid foundation for the project and ensures that the end product meets the user's expectations.

Enter Crudder, an upcoming social media platform built in the cloud, over a 13-14 week period. What makes Crudder unique is the expirational time-based nature of it's messages which the user has the option of posting publically while being in-full controll over the time-period before the message expires.
