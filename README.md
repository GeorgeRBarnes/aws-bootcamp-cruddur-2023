# Introducing Cruddur

Enter Cruddur, an upcoming social media platform built in the cloud over a 13-14 week period. What makes Cruddur unique is the expirational time-based nature of it's messages which the user has the option of posting publically while also being in-full control over the time-period in which the message is available to be viewed and interacted with by other users before it expires.
